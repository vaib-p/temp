## Step 4: Verify Your Files

Make sure you have these files in your project directory:

```

├── 📄 firebase.json
├── 📄 README.md
└── 📁 images/
    ├── 📄 WhatsApp Image 2025-07-25 at 12.52.14 PM.jpeg

```

## Step 5: Deploy to Firebase

```bash

```

## Step 6: Access Your Website

After successful deployment, you'll see output like:

```
✔  Deploy complete!

Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/your-project-id/overview
Hosting URL: https://your-project-id.web.app
```

Your website will be live at: `https://your-project-id.web.app`

## 🎯 Quick Test

1. **Test the countdown:** Visit your website and see the countdown
2. **Test celebration:** Uncomment the test line in `index.html`:
   ```javascript
   // setTimeout(() => testCelebration(), 3000);
   ```
3. **Test music:** Click the music button to play your `abc.mp3`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "firebase command not found"
**Solution:** Reinstall Firebase CLI:
```bash
npm uninstall -g firebase-tools
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Solution:** On Windows, run Command Prompt as Administrator. On Mac/Linux, use `sudo`:
```bash
sudo npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### Issue: "Project not found"
**Solution:** Make sure you're logged in and have created a project:
```bash
firebase login
firebase projects:list
```

### Issue: Images not loading
**Solution:** Check that all image paths in `index.html` are correct and files exist in the `images/` folder.

## 📱 Mobile Testing

1. **Test on mobile:** Visit your website on your phone
2. **Test touch interactions:** Make sure all buttons work
3. **Test music:** Ensure music plays on mobile devices

## 🔄 Updating Your Website

To make changes and redeploy:

1. **Edit your files** (index.html, etc.)
2. **Test locally** by opening index.html in your browser
3. **Deploy again:**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy
   ```
